## 1. Raw Data (1_RawData)

This example reads raw NMEA sentences from the GPS module and prints them to the Serial Monitor.

### Steps to Run:
1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer via USB.
3. Select **Raspberry Pi Pico** as the board.
4. Open the `1_RawData` sketch.
5. Copy the code to Arduino IDE and  **Upload** to flash the code onto the Pico.
6. Open **Serial Monitor** (115200 baud) to view the raw GPS data.

### Expected Output:
```
$GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9,M,,*47
$GPRMC,123519,A,4807.038,N,01131.000,E,022.4,084.4,230394,003.1,W*6A
```

## 2. Parse Data (2_ParseData)

This example extracts latitude and longitude from NMEA sentences and prints them in a readable format.

### Steps to Run:
1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer via USB.
3. Select **Raspberry Pi Pico** as the board.
4. Open the `2_ParseData` sketch.
5. Copy the code to Arduino IDE and  **Upload** to flash the code onto the Pico.
6. Open **Serial Monitor** (9600 baud) to view the parsed GPS data.

### Expected Output:
```
Latitude: 48.1173Â° N
Longitude: 11.5167Â° E
Time: 12:35:19 UTC
```

## 3. OpenPLC Integration (3_OpenPLC)

This example integrates GPS data into OpenPLC, allowing the Pico to send location data for automation purposes.

### Steps to Run:
1. Install **OpenPLC Editor** on your computer.
2. Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer via USB.
3. Open **Arduino IDE** and upload the `3_OpenPLC` sketch.
4. Launch OpenPLC Runtime and select the Pico as the target device.
5. Configure OpenPLC to read latitude and longitude as external variables.
6. Run OpenPLC and observe live location data being processed.
